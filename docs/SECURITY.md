# Security

This plugin ships with a supply-chain and static-analysis pipeline wired into
both CI and the release build. Everything runs through `make`, so what CI checks
is exactly what you can reproduce locally — there are no CI-only gates.

GitHub also treats this file as the repository's security policy (it looks in
`docs/SECURITY.md`), so the reporting section below is what shows up under the
**Security** tab.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do **not** open a public issue for a security vulnerability. Report it privately:

- Use **GitHub → Security → Report a vulnerability** (private vulnerability
  reporting) on this repo, or
- Email the maintainers listed in `plugin.json` (`support_url`).

Include repro steps, affected version, and impact. Expect an acknowledgement
within a few business days.

## What runs, and when

| Check | Make target | CI workflow | Gate |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------|
| SBOM generation (CycloneDX) | `make sbom` | `security.yml`, `release.yml` | — |
| Dependency CVE scan (Grype) | `make sbom-scan` | `security.yml`, `release.yml` | Fails on **HIGH/CRITICAL** |
| SBOM + scan in one step | `make sbom-audit` | — | Fails on **HIGH/CRITICAL** |
| Static analysis (CodeQL, Go + JS/TS) | `make codeql-analyze` | `security.yml`, `release.yml` | — |
| CodeQL finding gate | `make security-gate` | `security.yml`, `release.yml` | Fails on **error-level** findings |
| Malware scan of artifacts (ClamAV) | `make virus-scan` | `release.yml` | Fails on infected files |
| Detached GPG signature | `make release-sign` | `release.yml` | Skipped if no key configured |
| SHA256 checksum | `make release-checksum` | `release.yml` | — |

`security.yml` runs on every PR, every push to `main`, and weekly (to catch
newly-disclosed CVEs against unchanged code). `release.yml` runs the full chain
on every `v*` tag via `make release`.

SARIF from Grype and CodeQL is uploaded to **GitHub Code Scanning**, so findings
appear inline on PRs and in the Security tab.

## Requirement: enable Code Scanning

The SARIF upload steps are **visibility-aware** via
`continue-on-error: ${{ github.event.repository.private }}`:

- On **public** repos the upload is required — if Code Scanning is off it fails
  and the workflow goes red, so findings reach the Security tab.
- On **private** repos (where Code Scanning needs paid GitHub Advanced Security)
  the upload is tolerated — a missing GHAS license doesn't fail CI.

- **Public repos:** free. Enable under **Settings → Code security and analysis**.
- **Private repos:** requires GitHub Advanced Security (paid). If you can't
  enable it, **keep** the `upload-sarif` steps as-is — the `continue-on-error`
  above already tolerates the failed upload. The `make security-gate` / Grype
  `--fail-on high` gates remain the real enforcement either way.

## Running the checks locally

```sh
# Dependency CVEs (generates SBOMs, scans them, fails on HIGH/CRITICAL)
make sbom-audit

# Static analysis (downloads the CodeQL CLI bundle on first run, ~500MB)
make codeql-analyze
make security-gate

# Full release pipeline, exactly as CI runs it on a tag
make release
```

Tool installers are wired into the targets that need them (`install-sbom-tools`,
`install-grype`, `install-codeql`, `install-clamav`), so you don't install
anything by hand.

## Suppressing false positives (Grype)

Not every CVE applies to what actually ships. Common legitimate cases:

- A dev-only transitive dependency (eslint, babel, webpack) that never lands in
  `webapp/dist/main.js` or the server binary.
- A dependency Mattermost externalizes at runtime (react, redux), so the
  vulnerable copy in `node_modules` never ships in the bundle.

Add an entry to [`.grype.yaml`](../.grype.yaml) with a **reason** so the
suppression is auditable:

```yaml
ignore:
  - vulnerability: GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz
    package:
      name: some-package
      type: npm
    reason: "Dev-only transitive dependency not shipped in plugin bundle"
```

Keep suppressions specific (pin the CVE and package) and time-box them where you
can — re-check on the next dependency bump rather than suppressing forever.

## Signing releases (optional)

Release signing is off until you configure a key. To enable it, add two repo
secrets (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

- `PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY` — ASCII-armored private GPG key
- `PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY_PASSPHRASE` — its passphrase

`release.yml` imports the key and `make release-sign` produces a detached
`.sig` attached to the GitHub Release. Consumers verify with:

```sh
gpg --verify <bundle>.tar.gz.sig <bundle>.tar.gz
```

## Dependency updates

Dependabot ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml)) opens weekly
PRs for Go modules, npm packages, and GitHub Actions, and repo-level security
updates fire immediately when an advisory lands. GitHub Actions are pinned to
full commit SHAs — a moved tag can't swap the code — and Dependabot is what
keeps those pins current.
